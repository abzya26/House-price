Objective
To develop an accurate, data-driven model that forecasts residential property prices using advanced regression techniques and real-world housing data. The goal is to assist homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals in making informed pricing decisions.

Problem Statement
Traditional pricing models often fail to account for complex, nonlinear relationships among housing features. This project aims to overcome those limitations by applying intelligent regression methods that can capture intricate patterns in the data, ultimately improving prediction accuracy.

Key Features
Data Source: Real estate datasets from Kaggle, Zillow, or government housing records.

Target Variable: Sale price of houses.

Predictors: Lot size, square footage, location, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, year built, condition, amenities, etc.

Approach
Data Collection & Preprocessing

Data cleaning (handling missing values, outliers)

Feature engineering (e.g., age of house, distance to city center)

Normalization/encoding of categorical variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis

Correlation heatmaps

Visualization of feature impacts on price

Modeling Techniques

Baseline: Linear Regression

Smart Regression Models:

Ridge & Lasso Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Neural Networks (optional advanced step)

Model Evaluation

Performance metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ²

Cross-validation

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Model Deployment (optional)

Build an interactive dashboard or web app using Streamlit or Flask

Expected Outcomes
A well-performing regression model with high predictive accuracy

Insights into key features driving house prices

Scalable framework applicable to various real estate markets

Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost)

Jupyter Notebooks

Git for version control

(Optional) Streamlit or Flask for deployment
